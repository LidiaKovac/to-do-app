## Topics :
  - Redux 
  - Redux Thunk
  - Hooks
  - Socket.IO BE/FE
  - Typescript BE/FE
  - Auth / OAuth
## Frontend:
  - Step 1: CRA - Typescript 
  - Step 2: Install Redux and Redux Thunk
    - Since this is a TS React App, to use Redux we need some additional setup: 
      - with the library [Redux Devtools Extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-devtools-extension) we are able to set the brower extension without running into typescript issues. Since we don't need to do anything particular with the extension, I just used the composeWithDevTools() function in the export instead of declaring it as a constant.
